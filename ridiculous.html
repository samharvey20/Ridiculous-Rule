      <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p> This past winter I had a ridiculous situation in school. It was a monday morning, snowing, and I thought we were going to have off school so I didnt finish any of my homework. Ms. Manelski came up to me, said that I had to throw my coffee away and that I was getting an infraction. Mind you that this was before school! I think that if it was a bigger problem it could have been handled differently and I think that it is not a big deal to have a drink other than water in school.<p>
